## Model Details
### faster_rcnn_sim
This model is optimized to classify simulator images. This model is based on Faster R-CNN Resnet model architecture and created using TensorFlow's Object Detection API. Model is first trained using [Bosch Small traffic Light Data set](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/6132) and then fine tuned for a hand annotated set of images from the Udacity Simulator.
#### Model Params:
epochs : 10000
learning rate : 0.0003
